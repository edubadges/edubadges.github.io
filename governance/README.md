# Governance
*Governance document 19 October 2022, Version: 1*

The governance model describes the decision-making process and the role of various members of the [Community](#community-governance), [Metadata group](#metadata-group-governance), and [Project group](#project-group-governance). It also outlines the strategic goals and procedures within the project, and provides an understanding of how Edubadges is governed.

The shared goals of the governance model are:

* **Sustainability**: ensure the sustainability and health of the project and the Community.
* **Structure**: provide structure to the organization so that the decision-making process is clear.
* **Transparency**: provide transparency to the Community about the participation in and decision-making within the project;
* **Growth**: provide a structure that can develop according to the needs of new adopters and developers, and that can support the Community.
* **Development**: support effective development and maintenance of Edubadges.

## Community (governance)
The Community consists of members (representatives) of education institutions and suppliers that work closely with SURF to further define and develop Edubadges. 
## Metadata group (governance)
The Working group is a subgroup of the Community and consists of a number of members that meet on a regular basis. 
## Project group (governance)
The Edubadges Project group consists of SURF employees or SURF contracts.

## Decisions within GitHub
For issues that affect the GitHub environment ([https://github.com/edubadges](https://github.com/edubadges "https://github.com/edubadges")), the following applies:

* The issue should be submitted to the master committer.
* The master committer then has 5 days to reach a decision.
* The decision is recorded within the GitHub environment.
* The voting procedure is started within these 5 days so that the decision can be voted on.
* The outcome of the vote is recorded.
* Any follow-up action is taken depending on the outcome of the vote.

## Bylaws and code of conduct
