## 3: The Open Badges and Digital Credentials Landscape

The launch of the Open Badges 3.0 specification, expected for final release in early 2023, arrives during a period in which “killer apps” for digital credentials have not yet appeared. The ecosystem of issuance and consumption of digital credentials remains immature, but many entities from private companies, to large universities and governmental entities, are investing heavily in exploration and product development. This chapter lays out important features of the landscape that product developers should understand as they choose how to develop their offerings and how to integrate with products offered by others.
