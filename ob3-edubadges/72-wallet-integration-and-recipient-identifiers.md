### 7.2: Wallet integration and recipient identifiers

When Edubadges selects an appropriate wallet partner based on the opportunities the proposed integration opens up for learners, Edubadges will have to implement an authentication and credential transmission workflow that is compatible with the chosen wallet. It is possible that changes will be necessary to the signed credential in order for this wallet to process it, or that Edubadges may have to guide the wallet vendor to support options important to Edubadges. Connection protocols and capabilities vary, but the following user stories are representative about the learnerâ€™s experience connecting to a VC wallet for the first time.

*   Connect a Verifiable Credentials Wallet: as a recipient, I can see the option to connect a wallet to Edubadges. I see that if I connect a wallet, I will be able to download my edubadges into the wallet.
*   I see that if I connect a wallet, I can receive my badges at an address I will control for a long time, rather than the university-assigned email I will lose access to.
*   I see a choice of wallets with at least one option for the eduID Wallet.
*   As a learner signed in to Edubadges on a desktop computer, I can initiate an integration with the eduID Wallet. I am shown documentation on how to download the wallet on my mobile device, and a QR code that I can scan from that device when I am finished installing it.
*   I scan the QR code and I am directed to the wallet application (via a deep link). I complete setting up my wallet if needed, and am prompted to approve a connection to the Edubadges service. I approve the connection, and in my browser on my mobile device, and on my desktop session after a few seconds, I see that the connection has been successfully made.
*   After I have connected a wallet, a DID shows up in my account as a self-sovereign identifier. I can select that badges issued in OB 3.0 format be issued to this identifier in addition to referencing the email address.
