### 7.5: Share a badge to LinkedIn as a Certification on a user’s Profile

See notes in [use case details](#sharing-to-linkedin-as-a-certification-on-the-profile) for technical details on how to generate a share URL that enables users to share their badges onto their LinkedIn profile.

*   As a learner, I can see on a badge I’ve earned an option to share to LinkedIn, to the “Certifications” section of my profile.
*   Perhaps there are two LinkedIn sharing options, one for the news feed, and one for the profile.
*   When I select the option to share to the LinkedIn profile, a new window opens, prefilled with relevant information from my badge.
*   I can confirm the information (including making minor edits if necessary), and once I submit, a certification is is added to my profile. The badge details page in my backpack is linked for users who want to get more information about this certification.
